## 🧠 Project Overview  
**Ball IQuiz** is a web-based football trivia game designed as my **CS50x final project**.  

It allows users to test their football knowledge by answering data-driven trivia questions under a time limit.  
This project reflects my ability to combine **backend and frontend development**, apply real-world **data querying**, and create a **dynamic, user-friendly experience** using modern web technologies.  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works  
- Users **register or log in** with a secure account.  
- A **countdown timer** starts as soon as the quiz begins.  
- Players answer a series of **random football-related questions**.  
- **Points are awarded** for each correct answer.  
- Scores are saved to a local **SQLite database**, allowing future retrieval.  

Each session uses randomized questions, ensuring a fresh and challenging experience every time.

---

## 📁 Files and Key Components  

### `app.py`  
The **main Flask file** that powers the application.  
It handles:
- User authentication and session management.  
- Password hashing via `Werkzeug`.  
- Routing between pages.  
- Interaction between frontend (HTML/JS) and the SQLite database.  

User accounts and scores are stored in `accounts.db`, with passwords hashed for security.

---

### Frontend  
Built using:
- **HTML & CSS** for structure and styling.  
- **Bootstrap** for a responsive design that adapts to all screen sizes.  
- **JavaScript** for game logic, timers, user interaction, and dynamic content updates.  

I learned to integrate **Jinja templating syntax** with JavaScript to pass Flask variables directly into client-side logic — a challenge that significantly improved my understanding of web data flow.

---

### `questions.py`  
This module:
- Retrieves question data from the football dataset using SQL queries.  
- Randomizes question selection via Python’s `random` module.  
- Verifies answers and communicates results back to Flask routes.  

This file bridges the logic between **data processing** and **game interactivity**.

---

## 📊 Data Source  
The trivia questions are based on authentic football statistics from  
[**salimt/football-datasets**](https://github.com/salimt/football-datasets).  

It includes detailed information on:
- Player profiles and market values  
- Performance metrics and injury histories  
- National and club competitions  

Using this dataset allowed me to apply real SQL querying skills to extract and organize meaningful trivia content.

## 💡 Design Choices & Challenges  
As someone new to programming, building a **full-stack web app** was both exciting and challenging.  

Some key challenges and takeaways:  
- **Integrating JavaScript and Jinja syntax:** I learned how server-side data can dynamically update client-side scripts.  
- **Responsive design:** Bootstrap helped me ensure that the app looks clean on both mobile and desktop devices.  
- **Timer logic:** Managing countdown timers and sound effects while new questions loaded required careful asynchronous control.  
- **Performance optimization:** I discovered how preloading audio, caching, and file structure affect performance — and how to fix it.  

Every challenge deepened my understanding of **web architecture**, **data handling**, and **asynchronous logic**.

---

## 🤖 Integration with AI  
Throughout the project, I actively used **ChatGPT (OpenAI)** as a collaborative learning tool.  

It helped me:
- Understand complex Flask and JavaScript interactions.  
- Debug efficiently and learn best practices.  
- Explore alternative solutions when I hit obstacles.  
- Improve my technical writing, code organization, and documentation.  

This experience strengthened my ability to **learn quickly**, **communicate effectively**, and **use AI tools responsibly** to accelerate problem-solving — an increasingly valuable skill in modern development environments.

## 🧩 Key Features  
✅ User authentication and session tracking  
✅ Football data integrated via SQL queries  
✅ Randomized question selection  
✅ Countdown timer with sound effects  
✅ Responsive layout and animations via Bootstrap  
✅ Real-time feedback for correct/incorrect answers  
✅ Secure password hashing and session management  

---

## 🧠 Lessons Learned  
Through **Ball IQuiz**, I developed foundational and transferable skills, including:
- Building RESTful web apps with **Flask**  
- Writing and querying SQL databases  
- Managing client-server communication via **JSON**  
- Frontend interactivity using **JavaScript**  
- Styling and responsive design using **CSS & Bootstrap**  
- Debugging and improving code performance  
- Collaborating effectively with **AI tools** to solve technical challenges  

This project taught me not just how to code, but how to **think like a developer**.
